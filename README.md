# Non-Rigid Registration with Deep Learning and Conformal Harmonic Maps

## About
This has all associated code related to my master's thesis, _Non-Rigid Registration with Deep Learning and Conformal Harmonic Maps_. The conformal map code used a modified version of code licensed by my thesis advisor and used in commercial applications, so that is not included, though mentions of it remain in the rest of the repository.

## Licensing
If you wish to use this code for commercial purposes, please contact me via email [here](mailto:billmannd@gmail.com)

## Thesis
I have provided a free ![copy of my thesis](Non_Rigid_Registration_with_Deep_Learning_and_Conformal_Harmonic_Maps.pdf) for your enjoyment.
