# Non-Rigid Registration with Deep Learning and Conformal Harmonic Maps

## About
This has all associated code related to my master's thesis, _Non-Rigid Registration with Deep Learning and Conformal Harmonic Maps_. The conformal map code used a modified version of code licensed by my thesis advisor and used in commercial applications, so that is not included, though mentions of it remain in the rest of the repository.
